    review:
      "I have never experienced such an amazing dentist office in my life. The time and dedication they take with their patients is absolutely incredible. Dr. Mike took time to explain everything and make me feel comfortable and valued as a patient. They have created something really special. The level of respect and professionalism is out of this world. As a business owner myself I am more than impressed with how they operate.",

      "I love this place! I’ve never had such a pleasant experience at a dentist before. Dr Mike is so knowledgeable and talked me through every step to ensure I felt comfortable. I love that they bring you in for an initial session to get an assessment of your teeth before the cleaning. I was not pressured into any procedures which I appreciated. The clinic is spotless, and Arden is so lovely! Can’t wait to come back.",

      "Easily the best dental care I've received (20+ years in the GTA). Michael and Arden are incredibly thorough and professional. The facilities are clean, comfortable, and equipped with modern equipment. The experience is informative, fun, and painless! Would highly recommend, particularly for Invisilign services too.",
