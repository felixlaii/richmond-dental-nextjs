    review:
      "I have never experienced such an amazing dentist office in my life. The time and dedication they take with their patients is absolutely incredible. Dr. Mike took time to explain everything and make me feel comfortable and valued as a patient. They have created something really special. The level of respect and professionalism is out of this world. As a business owner myself I am more than impressed with how they operate.",

      "I love this place! I’ve never had such a pleasant experience at a dentist before. Dr Mike is so knowledgeable and talked me through every step to ensure I felt comfortable. I love that they bring you in for an initial session to get an assessment of your teeth before the cleaning. I was not pressured into any procedures which I appreciated. The clinic is spotless, and Arden is so lovely! Can’t wait to come back.",

    review:
      "I am delighted with the services I received from Dr. Michael Li and his staff. I had a very complicated procedure done to perfection by Dr. Michael, who kept me well informed throughout the process. The clinic has new technology and techniques to help patients receive the latest treatments, making the experience very informative and relaxing. The office is very clean, super friendly and welcoming; you can relax by watching videos on a ceiling screen. Dr. Li also offers services to patients with various disabilities from ODSP, and I have worked helping this population. Because of that, he is also incorporating a positive social inclusion approach that benefits, and this is even more favourable for me. I highly recommend the Richmond West Dental Clinic; you will love Dr. Li's innovation and skill, the new technology, and the positive and friendly environment!",

      "Excellent service and overall great experience. For someone who has always been anxious about going to the Dentist, Dr. Le and his staff made me feel comfortable and at ease the entire time, even during my first cavity filling experience! Could not recommend them enough.",

      "Easily the best dental care I've received (20+ years in the GTA). Michael and Arden are incredibly thorough and professional. The facilities are clean, comfortable, and equipped with modern equipment. The experience is informative, fun, and painless! Would highly recommend, particularly for Invisilign services too.",

    review:
      "Dr. Le is the best dentist I’ve ever had in my life - seriously. He is patient, conservative (doesn’t recommend treatment unless you actually need it) and is very detailed in his work. I appreciate that he is also younger because it’s evident he is up to date with the latest research/best practices/equipment, etc. His dental office is has a bright, clean, welcoming feel and all the equipment is new and up to date, which is so important in this day and age. No more spitting and splashing all over with these old school bowls beside you, ew! Dr. Le will take his time and explain all procedures and risks and overall, just does such an amazing job. I am so happy with my teeth and smile after Invisalign and whitening and of course routine cleanings. I will definitely be one of his forever patients and highly recommend.",

    review:
      "honestly: by far the best dental experience i've had in my 39 years walking this earth. arden and dr. le are both just the right balance of friendly and professional, they're very transparent with what treatments will cost, have cool tech i've never seen in a dental office and clearly work hard to make each appointment as pleasant as possible. from the full size-range of black crocs for patients to the extra tv on the ceiling for entertainment while being worked on - even if i moved away from the neighbourhood i would stay on as a patient here. i'm a picky guy but honestly, no complaints here whatsoever - and they aren't even paying me for this review! it's hard to say i look forward to going to my dental appointments now but it's as close to that as possible.",

      "Dr. Le is the best! Most gentle cleanings (where you can watch Netflix or listen to music of your choice) and thorough explanations. I always leave happy and informed.",
