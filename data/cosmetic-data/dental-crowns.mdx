Crowns are tooth-shaped caps or coverings that protect a tooth’s length, shape, and overall aesthetics. There are a variety of materials that can be used to make dental crowns, including resin, ceramic, metal, and porcelain. Dental crowns are important if you have:

- Your tooth is weak and falling apart.
- It is necessary for you to repair a broken tooth.
- You’ve had your tooth filled and need to protect the filling especially where a considerable chunk of the tooth is missing.
- You have severely stained or misshapen teeth and want to improve their appearance.
- You have a dental implant
- The majority of our patients who need dental crowns at Richmond West Dental are adults. Some children, however, may benefit from dental crowns. Children who are at high risk for decay can get dental crowns to protect their primary or secondary teeth.


### Your Dental Crown’s Appointment in Downtown Toronto
Typically, dental crowns require two appointments. Our dentist will examine your teeth during the first appointment to see if they’re in good enough shape for a crown. You may need a root canal before you can get a crown to restore a tooth damaged by decay.

Once this has been completed, the dentist will take impressions of your teeth. Alternatively, it can be done electronically using a scanner or by using a paste or dental putty. These impressions are used by the dental lab to design a dental crown that will fit perfectly over your affected tooth and be perfectly aligned with your bite as well.

Your dentist may give you a temporary crown so you can use it while you wait for your permanent crown to be prepared if your tooth is in poor condition.

At the second appointment, the permanent crown is cemented in place once the dentist has made sure it fits, shapes, and colors match your teeth. Anesthesia is required for this step.

### Caring for Your Dental Crowns

To maintain a healthy dental crown, you should floss once a day and brush twice daily. The crowns may break if you consume hard foods. To ensure that your dental crowns are in good shape, be sure to visit Richmond West Dental in Toronto, Ontario for regular dental exams and cleanings.
