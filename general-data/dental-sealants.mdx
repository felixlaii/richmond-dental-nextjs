# Dental Sealants

People might discover that despite their efforts to keep their teeth healthy and strong, their back molars still are prone to decay and cavities. As a result, tooth structure often deteriorates and requires fillings. Richmond West Dental uses preventive dentistry to prevent cavities by applying dental sealants.

### What Are Dental Sealants

Dental sealants are small resin films applied as liquids to molars and then allowed to harden. As the resin is nonporous and degrades slowly, it acts as an excellent shield against corrosive acid and plaque attacks on the enamel of the teeth.

Patients of all ages can benefit from sealants, but children are the prime candidates because they work best after professional cleaning. The majority of dentists recommend sealant application between the ages of 6 and 14, but are willing to work with older patients who do not have molar decay.

### The Process

Before receiving dental sealants, teeth should be thoroughly scrubbed and cleaned. This removes plaque and bacteria that could get trapped under the sealant and eat away at the enamel and pulp. After cleaning the teeth, they are dried and protected by cotton to prevent them from getting wet.

Having protected the teeth, the tops are then treated with a weak acid solution. As a result, the sealant bonds better with the roughened surface. A second time of rinsing and drying is performed, and more cotton is applied. Then an enamel sealant is painted on the surface and allowed to dry. If necessary, our dentist may use a special hardening light to speed up the process. It should only take a few minutes.

As children grow up and become teenagers, the sealants will prevent tooth decay as they age.

### Where to Receive

Dental sealants are available at Richmond West Dental for patients who request them during their regular checkup and cleaning. It only takes a few minutes.
